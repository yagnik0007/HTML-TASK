<p><li>MCU fans will have to wait a little longer for Ironheart to drop on Disney+. 

    Starring Black Panther: Wakanda Forever's Dominique Thorne as Riri Williams (aka Ironheart), the Iron Man spin-off series is set to follow the genius MIT student skilled in creating suits rivaling those of Tony Stark. 
    
    After being on the Disney+ docket for years, and following cancellation concerns, Ironheart just received a new official, and yet somewhat disappointing, release update.</li></p>

        A 2025 release also means Ironheart will have been delayed for roughly two years since Marvel Studios initially slated the series for a Fall 2023 release at 2022's San Diego Comic-Con. 
        
        In addition to Dominique Thorne, Ironheart will also star Anthony Ramos as Parker Robbins or The Hood, as well as Solo: A Star Wars Story's Alden Ehrenreich. 
        
        The legacy and influence of Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man is also expected to have a presence in the show since Riri builds similar high-tech armored suits. 
        
        While the extent of that presence is unknown, the Black Panther: Wakanda Forever - The Art of the Movie book confirmed a connection between Ironheart and Iron Man, with concept illustrator Josh Nizzi revealing that "Riri is obviously aware of his work," and her suits show Iron Man's "influence:"</li></p>
