<font size="6"><b>&diams;Our story</b></font>
<ul>
    <font size="5"><li>Simplicity never goes out of style - this has been our philosophy at STAC and one of the many things that brought us together! Our frustration with the lack of this simplicity in the fine jewellery we owned made us think of STAC. All the pieces we owned were heavy, kept in our bank lockers and taken out only for special occasions. We realized this was the case with most girls in our generation and so decided to build something that every girl has most likely looked for but couldn’t find –</li></font></ul>
    <br>

    <ul>
        <font size="5"><li>Fine jewellery that can be worn every day, that the modern girl feels proud to own, and that doesn’t break the bank!At STAC you will find jewellery in 18 kt gold, which is classic, minimalist and contemporary that you can enjoy wearing everyday, while dressing up or down!</li></font></ul>
        <br>

        <font size="6"><b>&diams;THE FOUNDERS</b></font>
        <ul>
            <font size="5"><li>Aakriti comes from a family who has been in the jewellery industry for years, she has spent most of her childhood seeing her mother design pieces (including her own wedding jewellery!) and so had the basic knowledge and resources to help set up the manufacturing and quality control.Rashi having launched a premium consumer facing company in India brought her learnings in consumer behavior, digital marketing and e-commerce to the table and together they were ready to “STAC” the younger generation of jewellery buyers.</li></font></ul>
